# Repository management best practices

When you work on BC Government projects, make sure to use your _public.servant@gov.bc.ca_ as your primary email address. Use your work email address for any work done in a professional capacity. Refer to the [Social Media Guidelines](http://www.gov.bc.ca/citz/citizens_engagement/some_guidelines_master.pdf) for conduct guidelines when using GitHub's social media features.

## Content requirements

For more information on the content requirements for your repository, see [Operate and maintain a BCGov GitHub project](operate-maintain-bcgov-github-project.md).

Follow the proper conventions laid out in the contributing.md file for the repository when you create, fork, modify, and submit pull requests.

## Privacy guidelines

Using GitHub may require you to use other related services. Before signing up, work with your supervisor to make sure the Legal Services and Risk Management branches have reviewed the Terms of Service. If your professional work requires you to use non-BC Government repositories, read the licensing guidelines (see [Licenses](Licenses.md)) to make sure government doesn't take on undue risk.

## Licences

Before publishing content to GitHub, choose a suitable licence from the list of approved licences and confirm your authority to license (see [Licenses](Licenses.md)).

Complete the [Open Content publishing checklist](Content-Approval-Checklist.md) before making any contributions. The checklist addresses privacy, intellectual property rights, and information security. This helps ensure the content posted to GitHub can be published under the appropriate licence.
