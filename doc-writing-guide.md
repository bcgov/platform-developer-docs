## Basics
- [Use contractions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/word-choice/use-contractions)
- Use simple words and phrases. Replace more complex words and phrases with a simpler alternative, where possible.
- Write in the present tense.
- Omit needless verbs, adverbs, and double verbs.
- Use specific verbs.
- Use full words and little jargon (for example, repo vs repository, admin vs administrator). Strike a balance between formal and approachable. It can be done.
- [Don't use Latin abbreviations](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2016/07/20/changes-to-the-style-guide-no-more-eg-and-ie-etc/) (e.g., i.e., etc.). They're not always familiar to non-native English speakers, they don't always get read correctly by screen readers, and people don't speak Latin. Write around them or use the proper English.
- Avoid the passive voice. Use verb-forward language. Who does what? What performs what action?
- [Don't write FAQs](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/07/25/faqs-why-we-dont-have-them/).
- Front load your content. What is the most important part of a given sentence? Give the reader what they need the most as soon as possible.
- Use a descriptive and specific title. What does the reader _do_ with the page? What specific information do they gain?
- Generally, you don't want to tell people what not to do.
- Define abbreviations at first use.
- Spell out numbers one to ten, use digits for everything after.
- Use images sparingly. If you need to use images, make sure they are supplementary to the writing. Don't rely on them to explain a process. Accessibility // out of date // links that can't be clicked // no alt text // branding and style
