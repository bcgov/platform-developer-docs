# Remove a user's BCGov GitHub access

When a user no longer needs access to a repository, the product owner or administrator of the repository must remove the user. They also have to request removal of their access from the organization by using the [Just Ask! tool](https://just-ask-web-bdec76-prod.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/).

Include the following in the request:

* User's full name
* User's GitHub ID
* The GitHub repository you are removing the user from

Use the following example as a reference when you submit a request:

```markdown
GitHub User Access Removal Request:
- Full name: Govvie McGovster
- GitHub ID: govviemcgovster
- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/bcgov/govvie-gov, https://github.com/bcgov/govviest-gov
```
