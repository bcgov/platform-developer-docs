# Required pages for a GitHub repository
When you create a repository in the `bcgov` organization, add the following markdown files:
- License
- README
- Code of conduct
- Contribution guidelines

## Licence
Choose a licence and place a licence file in your repository before you do anything else. For important information on licences, see [License your project](license-your-project.md).

Depending on the licence you choose, add boilerplate text for the applicable licence to your README file.

## ReadMe
GitHub has extensive documentation on how to create a good README file for your repository. Follow these guidelines when you create your readme.

For more information, see [About READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes).

Make sure to include the following:
- A brief description of your project.
- An overview on how to contribute to the repository with a link to your contribution guidelines.
- Depending on your licence, boilerplate text for the applicable licence. For more information, see [License your project](license-your-project.md).
- A link to your code of conduct file.

## Code of conduct
Write a clear code of conduct to ensure contributors to your project foster an open and welcoming environment.

Two good starting points to create a code of conduct for your project are the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/) and GitHub's guidelines on [Healthy contributions](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions).

## Contribution guidelines
Write concise and clear contribution guidelines. Let potential contributors know how you prefer they work on projects and give them the correct info to do so.

For example, if you prefer contributors fork repositories and submit [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), provide links to the applicable documentation.

Make sure you're clear on the licence that applies to your repository and provide a link to relevant documentation.
