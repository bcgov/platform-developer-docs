We also talked about including a page that gets a little more into the details of IDIR vs Github IDs across the whole cluster and all our services, so I'll add some notes at the bottom of this comment detailing what I'd like to see in such a document!

    * Since this is the more generalized document, let's just have one section for logging in instead of specifying one section for logging in with Github and one for logging in with IDIR.

    * Near the top of this section, we should have a "do I log in with IDIR or Github?" FAQ call out that points the user to the new "IDIR vs Github ID" document (which should be where users can find all that information about project leads needing IDIRs in the future and stuff).

    * Let's keep the mention that MFA is required (because MFA is required whether you have Github or IDIR) but maybe generalize it. Again, we might want to provide some links to "How to set up MFA" docs for each IDIR and Github IDs. https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/information-security-mfa

    * Most of the stuff under the "Information for Developers" section should probably be moved to the "IDIR vs Github" doc instead, since it isn't directly relevant to how to login to Openshift.

    * Add a section that explains how to see which namespaces you have access to in the Openshift Console. This should include an explanation of what you would expect to see if you haven't been added to any namespaces yet, and what to do about it (aka ask your project lead to add you to the namespace).

    * Add a section that explains how to login to the Openshift CLI.

# Login to OpenShift

Teams can login to the Openshift with either a GitHub ID or IDIR. IDIR authentication is enabled in the Silver cluster of the Openshift Platform. You must have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled to log in with either GitHub or your IDIR. This access mechanism links to Azure Active Directory (AD). You can find instructions on how to enable MFA for your IDIR account [here](<!-- where? -->)

You have to login with IDIR into the Openshift Console before you can associate any role bindings with the IDIR account.

When you login to the Silver Cluster Openshift Console, you have the option of using GitHub or your Azure AD IDIR.

## Information for developers <!-- is there a better heading for this? -->
GitHub accounts are still the default authentication mechanism for our developers.

We will update the [Platform Project Registry](https://registry.developer.gov.bc.ca/) to use IDIR user accounts and BC government email identifiers for product owners and technical leads to ensure that namespace administrative level controls are tied to an account that we have more control over. There is not yet a target date for this change. Make sure all contractors listed as tech leads for projects on the platform have active IDIR accounts.

Some teams may choose to have all team members migrated to IDIR account use for OpenShift platform access.  This isn't required.

We want teams to migrate their role bindings from their GitHub accounts to IDIR on their own, and deprovision the GitHub accounts, if necessary.

We're investigating IDIR security groups integration, but it's not in place yet. This requires a synchronization between our datacentre active directory and the Azure Active Directory that is not fully in place yet.

We don't intend to leverage SSO integration for IDIR onto GitHub at this time. You'll still use GitHub accounts to access GitHub content.

**Note**: There won't be automated migration for the namespace access role bindings created for the GitHub ID to the IDIR accounts performed by the Platform Services Team. Any such migrations would have to be done by product teams themselves.

If you have any questions or concerns about this change, post your question in [#devops-security channel](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/devops-security) in RocketChat and tag Nick Corcoran, our Platform Security Architect.
