# Training from the Platform Services Team
Learning how to build in openshift can be hard. We’ve put together a number of resources to help!

## On this page
- [Openshift 101 and 201](#openshift101201)
- [Video Resources](#)

## Openshift 101 and 201 <a name="openshift101201"></a>

Your first step in learning Openshift is signing up for [Openshift 101 Workshop](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/311464688267/) and the [Openshift 101 Lab](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/311481077287). 

If the course fills up, email platformservicesteam@gov.bc.ca - preference is given to recently onboarded teams. If you’re unable to attend a training session, we will soon be offering recordings. 

We’re developing an Openshift 201 course to cover more advanced skills than the 101 course.
