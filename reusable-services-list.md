# Reusable services list
Find details on the following services or tools you can use as part of your project in `bcgov`.

## Messaging Common Service
The Common Messaging service (CMSG) is an API for sending messages to internal and external users through SMTP and SMS. You can access the CMSG programmatically through the CMSG-MESSAGING-API. For more information, see the following resources:
* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bcgov/nr-messaging-service-showcase).
* [About the Messaging Common Service](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Community-Contributed-Content/About-the-Messaging-Common-Service)
* [Messaging Service Developer Guide](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Community-Contributed-Content/Messaging-Service-Developer-Guide)

### Features
The CMSG implements a REST API to Oracle’s User Messaging Service, part of the Oracle Fusion Middleware stack. Oracle software gives you the ability to delay sending messages and check message statuses. Guaranteed delivery is also an option.

However, you can't currently send SMS content through the CMSG-MESSAGING-API, use timed email release, or guaranteed email delivery. You can also add attachments to messages, but only PDF documents currently.

The API supports HTML content. The value of mediaType in the request should be text or HTML to render HTML content in the email.

## Backup Container

[Backup Container](https://github.com/BCDevOps/backup-container) is a simple, containerized backup solution used to backup one or more supported databases to a secondary location. The code and documentation was originally pulled from [HETS Project](https://github.com/bcgov/hets).

### Features
You can use the following databases:
* MongoDB
* PostgresSQL
* MSSQL (MSSQL requires the NFS DB volume is shared with the database for backups to function correctly)
* MariaDB

You can run Backup Container for supported databases separately or in a mixed environment.

For more information on Backup Container, see the following pages:
* [Backup Container](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Community-Contributed-Content/Backup-Container)
* [backup-container repository](https://github.com/BCDevOps/backup-container)
* [jag-cullencommission repository](https://github.com/bcgov/jag-cullencommission/tree/master/openshift)

## BC Address Geocoder

The BC Address Geocoder REST API lets you integrate real-time standardization, validation, and geocoding of physical addresses into your applications. See [this page](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-address-geocoder-web-service/resource/40d6411e-ab98-4df9-a24e-67f81c45f6fa/view/1d3c42fc-53dc-4aab-ae3b-f4d056cb00e0) for information on aspects of the REST API that aren't covered in the OpenAPI definition.

The Geocoder helps you validate and geocode addresses (including public and related business occupants), find physical sites, intersections, and occupants, and find sites, intersections, and occupants near a point or within an area. The current baseUrl for the online geocoder is https://geocoder.api.gov.bc.ca/.

The URL allows both public and gated access. Gated access requires an APIkey. To get a sandbox APIkey with a maximum rate of 1000 requests per minute, visit the [Geocoder API console](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-address-geocoder-web-service/resource/40d6411e-ab98-4df9-a24e-67f81c45f6fa/view/1d3c42fc-53dc-4aab-ae3b-f4d056cb00e0). You can get an unrestricted APIkey for use in government applications by opening a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/7/create/15).

For more information on the BC Address Geocoder, see the following pages:
* [BC Address Geocoder Developer Guide](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Community-Contributed-Content/BC-Address-Geocoder-Developer-Guide)
* [BC Address Geocoder repository](https://github.com/bcgov/api-specs/blob/master/geocoder/glossary.md#outputSRS)

## Common Document Generation Service
Use the Document Generation service (DGEN) to generate documents using template files that contains field values from a database. Once generated, the completed document is stored in the Document Management Service (DMS) repository where you can view and sign it with an electronic signature. You must access DGEN programmatically through the [DGEN-API](https://api.nrs.gov.bc.ca/dgen-api/). You can find a description of the API in the [Natural Resource Ministry's (NRM) API Store](https://apistore.nrs.gov.bc.ca/store/apis/info?name=dgen-api&version=v1&provider=admin).

### Features

DGEN is based upon a commercial product from [Windward](https://www.windwardstudios.com/). The DGEN-API exposes some of the services provided by Windward's document generation engine and provides a layer of abstraction between the Windward commercial product and users of the DGEN service. If needed, Windward can be changed out at a later date and replaced by an open-source product without changes to the DGEN-API.

Some business areas within NRM built customized document generation engines (for example, Crown Lands, e-Licensing). However, they tend to be maintenance intensive, are limited to specific business areas and technologies, and require updates each time Microsoft Office is updated.

The Windward document generation engine is a server-based process that can be used by any business area within the NRM. It's compatible with Microsoft Office tools, but unlike Microsoft Office macros, the Windward document templates are XML-based and have minimal dependencies on specific versions of Microsoft Office. DGEN uses XML template files that are developed using Windward's Template Designer plug-in.

Windward offers a number of [quick-start materials](https://www.windwardstudios.com/resources/quick-start).

For more information on DGEN, see the following pages:
* [DGEN Developer's Guide](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Community-Contributed-Content/DGEN-Developer's-Guide)
* [Document Generation Showcase](https://github.com/bcgov/document-generation-showcase)

## Common Hosted Email Service
The Common Hosted Email service is hosted by the `bcgov` organization. For more information on the application, see the following pages:
* [Common Hosted Email service](https://bcgov.github.io/common-hosted-email-service/app/)
* [common-hosted-email-service repository](https://github.com/bcgov/common-hosted-email-service)

## Common Services Get Token
The Common Services Get Token (also known as GETOK) is a web-based tool for development teams to manage their application's secure access to Common Services. Users can create and deploy service clients instantly to gain access to common service APIs like email notifications, document management, or document generation.

For more information, see the following pages:
* [nr-get-token repository](https://github.com/bcgov/nr-get-token)
* [Common Services showcase](https://bcgov.github.io/common-service-showcase/)

## SonarQube in Private Cloud PaaS
[SonarQube®](https://www.sonarqube.org/) is an automatic code review tool you can use to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in your code. It can integrate with your existing workflow to enable continuous code inspection across your project branches and pull requests.

When a piece of code does not comply with a rule, an issue is logged on the snapshot. An issue can be logged on a source file or a unit test file.

For more information, see [SonarQube Best Practices](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Platform-Services-Security/SonarQube-Best-Practices).

## SonarQube on OpenShift
The [sonarqube repository](https://github.com/BCDevOps/sonarqube) contains all the resources you might need to deploy a SonarQube server instance in a BC government OpenShift pathfinder environment and integrate SonarQube scanning into your Jenkins pipeline.

This work was inspired by the [OpenShift Demos SonarQube for OpenShift](https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/sonarqube-openshift-docker).

For more information, see the following pages:
* [SonarQube on OpenShift](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Community-Contributed-Content/SonarQube-on-OpenShift)
