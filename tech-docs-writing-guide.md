## Formatting
Use the following guidelines for basic formatting.
- [Define abbreviations at first use](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/writing-guide/abbreviations#define-abbreviations).

  The only exception is if you're confident that the audience understands the abbreviation or it's so common that most people would know. For example, PDF, JPEG.

- Spell out numbers one to ten, use digits for everything after.

  For more guidance and exceptions, see [Writing numbers and dates in web content](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/writing-guide/numbers).

- Rules for lists are clearly laid out in the [Web Style Guide](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/writing-guide/lists).

- When writing code or commands, generally set them on their own line, like so:

  `code example that seriously rocks`

## Tone and voice
The [Grammar, spelling and tone](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/writing-guide/grammar-spelling-tone) section of the Web Style Guide thoroughly covers tone and voice, but here are the most important points to keep in mind:

- Avoid the passive voice and use verb-forward language. The best way to eliminate passive voice is to consider the person or thing performing the verb in the sentence you're writing. Who does what? Even if it's a thing and not a person. For example, a program notifies a person.

- [Use contractions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/word-choice/use-contractions).

- Use simple words and phrases. Replace more complex words and phrases with a simpler alternative, where possible.

- Write in the present tense.

- Omit needless verbs, adverbs, and double verbs.

- Use less jargon. Strike a balance between formal and approachable.

- [Don't use Latin abbreviations](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2016/07/20/changes-to-the-style-guide-no-more-eg-and-ie-etc/) (e.g., i.e., etc.). They're not always familiar to non-native English speakers, they don't always get read correctly by screen readers, and people don't speak Latin. Write around them or use the full term.

## Audience and perspective
The audience for the technical documentation generally has a high-level of devops knowledge and there are also other avenues for assistance (for example, RocketChat).

### Duplicate content
Don't duplicate content across pages. Remember the principle of **one topic = one page**. Rather than duplicating conent, link to content that's needed.

This also helps maintenance of documentation in the long run. If information or a process changes, only needs to be updated in one place. Do you future self a favour.

### Linking strategy
[The Nielson Norman Group has extensive and thorough guidance on writing excellent hyperlinks](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/writing-links/).

Make sure that the link to an external page is descriptive. The user should know (or have a good idea) where the link is going to take them before they click on it.

### FAQs
[Don't write FAQs](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/writing-guide/faqs) or format sections as a question and answer. Just tell the reader what they need to know.

## Page structure and elements

### Titles
Use a descriptive and specific title. What does the reader do with the page? What specific information do they gain?

Good titles help with findability and usability.

### Images
Use images sparingly. If you need to use images, make sure they are supplementary to the writing. Don't rely on them to explain a process.

Consider the following before using an image:

- Does the image should show something that can't be explained using words?

- Does the image meet [accessibility standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/home/accessible-government/toolkit/accessible-digital-content/graphics)?

- Will the image require updates in the future? (Remember, help future _you_)

- Does the image contain elements that need to be clicked on or interacted with but can't be? For example, hyperlinks.

### On this page

Use the **On this page** section as a simple table of contents. See this section on [Anchor links](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/writing-guide/links).

## Accessibility

## Writing instructions
- Front load your content. What is the most important part of a given sentence? Give the reader what they need the most as soon as possible.
- Generally, you don't want to tell people what not to do.
