# Reusable services list
Last updated: **November 28, 2023**

This document covers some of the most popular reusable components designed to enhance the feature and infrastructure of your applications. You can find out more about the services and tools below, and guidance on how to integrate them into your application. This list crosses with the [BCGov Common Components](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/common-components/) as well as the [BCGov Software as a Service (SaaS) catalog](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/cloud/services/saas/), feel free to check out from all three places when looking for a component to use!

## Backup Container
The [Backup Container](https://github.com/bcgov/backup-container) is an easy backup system. It helps you back up one or more databases to another place. You can also test restoring the database backups to make sure they work when needed. The code and documentation was originally pulled from [HETS Project](https://github.com/bcgov/hets).

### Features
These are the supported databases:
- MongoDB
- PostgresSQL
- MSSQL (MSSQL requires the NFS DB volume is shared with the database for backups to function correctly)
- MariaDB

### How-to
You can run Backup Container for supported databases separately or in a mixed environment. The service can be hosted as either a deployment with scheduled Database (DB) tasks or as a Cronjob in OpenShift. For more details on how to set it up, refer to the [backup-container repository](https://github.com/bcgov/backup-container).

## BC Address Geocoder
The BC Address Geocoder REST API lets you integrate real-time standardization, validation and geocoding of physical addresses into your applications. The current baseUrl for the online geocoder is `https://geocoder.api.gov.bc.ca/`.

### Features
The Geocoder helps you:
- Validate and geocode addresses (including public and related business occupants)
- Find physical sites, intersections and occupants
- Find sites, intersections and occupants near a point or within an area

### How-to
Follow the [BC Address Geocoder Developer Guide](https://github.com/bcgov/api-specs/blob/master/geocoder/geocoder-developer-guide.md) to get started. Please note that the URL allows both public and gated access. Gated access requires an APIkey. 

To get a sandbox APIkey with a maximum rate of 1000 requests per minute, visit the [Geocoder API console](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-address-geocoder-web-service). 

You can get an unrestricted APIkey for use in government applications by opening a ticket with the [Data Systems & Services request system](https://api.gov.bc.ca/).
