# Platform Architecture Diagram
Last updated: **August 22, 2023**

The platform architecture diagram provides a clear visual representation of the layout within the datacenter. It showcases the locations of different clusters and outlines the diverse range of services and features that each cluster offers.  

[View the diagram](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/cloud/services/private/internal-resources/diagram/) (protected by IDIR login). The diagram serves as a valuable tool for understanding how the datacenter's resources are organized and how various services are distributed across the infrastructure.
