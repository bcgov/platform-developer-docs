## How Rocky can help you

Welcome to your go-to guide for getting the most out of OpenShift and related resources! Whether you’re navigating the platform, hunting for website details, or looking to share feedback, I’m here to make things easier. Below, you’ll find an overview of how I can help and where to direct specific questions. Let’s dive in!

- **Have questions about OpenShift?** 🤔 I’ve got answers! Ask me anything about using the OpenShift platform, and I’ll pull info from our knowledge base faster than you can say “Kubernetes!”

> Remember, I’m here to help with OpenShift and the websites I know. If your question is outside my expertise, I’ll point you to our community-powered channel, [#devops-how-to](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/devops-how-to), where real humans can assist you better.

- **Got feedback?** 💬 I’d love it! Your feedback helps me improve. Give my answer a thumbs up or down, and I’ll take it from there. If you have more detailed feedback or suggestions, please ping my human caregiver at `@shelly.han`. We’re eager to hear from you! 

Let’s get started! Head over to the [rocky-chat channel](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/rocky-chat) and call me with `!rocky`, followed by your questions. Ask away!

**Important**: Don’t include sensitive personal information when chatting with me. This includes details about religious beliefs, government service history, sexuality, gender, health, private ID numbers, or similar data.

## How Rocky works 

Here’s a quick look behind the scenes:

- My DNA 🧬 is stored in the [Rocky repo](https://github.com/bcgov/rockychat)
- I live in the Silver cluster alongside my sibling, Rocky Test. (He gets to test new features first—I’m totally not jealous! 😅) But I’m the one you get to talk to!
- My brain 🧠 is powered by GPT-4 through [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service) and I’m always learning and improving!

## How to troubleshoot Rocky 

Sometimes things don’t go as planned—don’t worry, I’ve got you covered! Below are a few tips to ensure your questions get answered and ways to share your ideas or concerns. Let’s keep things running smoothly!

- If you asked a question and didn't hear back from me, please first check if you tagged me with `!rocky` (I'm not case sensitive but don't miss the exclamation mark). If there's no response still, please tag `@shelly.han` for support!
- If there are specific issues, concerns and/or feature requests, please create them as a Github Issue in the [Rocky repo](https://github.com/bcgov/rockychat).
