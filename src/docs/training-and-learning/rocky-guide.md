# Platform Services GenAI chatbot: Rocky

🎉 Hi! I’m Rocky from the Platform Services team, your friendly AI assistant in Rocket.Chat! 🤖✨ I’m here to help with the OpenShift platform and its related shared services. I’ve been trained using knowledge from these sources:
- [B.C. Government Private Cloud Private Cloud website](http://digital.gov.bc.ca/cloud/services/private)
- [Private cloud technical documentation website](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/platform-developer-docs/)
- [BCGov Internal StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.developer.gov.bc.ca/)


## Here’s how I can help you out:

- **Have questions about OpenShift?** 🤔 I’ve got answers! Ask me anything about using the OpenShift platform, and I’ll pull info from our knowledge base faster than you can say “Kubernetes!”
- **Need info from the sites above?** 🌐 I’m great at finding details! Whether it’s how-tos, troubleshooting tips, or best practices, if it’s on those sites, I’ll track it down for you.

> Remember, I’m here to help with OpenShift and the websites I know. If your question is outside my expertise, I’ll point you to our community-powered channel, [#devops-how-to](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/devops-how-to), where real humans can assist you better.

- **Got feedback?** 💬 I’d love it! Your feedback helps me improve. Give my answer a thumbs up or down, and I’ll take it from there. If you have more detailed feedback or suggestions, please ping my human caregiver at `@shelly.han`. We’re eager to hear from you! 

Let’s get started! Head over to the [rocky-chat channel](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/rocky-chat) and call me with `!rocky`, followed by your questions. Ask away!

**Important**: Please don’t include sensitive personal information when chatting with me. This includes details about religious beliefs, government service history, sexuality, gender, health, private ID numbers, or similar data.

## Curious about how I work?

Here’s a quick look behind the scenes:
- My DNA 🧬 is stored in the [Rocky repo](https://github.com/bcgov/rockychat)
- I live in the Silver cluster alongside my sibling, Rocky Test. (He gets to test new features first—I’m totally not jealous! 😅) But I’m the one you get to talk to!
- My brain 🧠 is powered by GPT-4 through [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service) and I’m always learning and improving!

## If something went wrong:

- If you asked a question and didn't hear back from me, please first check if you tagged me with `!rocky` (I'm not case sensitive but don't miss the exclamation mark). If still no response, please tag `@shelly.han` for support!
- If there are specific issues, concerns, and feature requests, please create them as a Github Issue in the [Rocky repo](https://github.com/bcgov/rockychat).
