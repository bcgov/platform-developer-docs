# Platform Services GenAI Chatbot - Rocky

🎉 Hi! I’m Rocky from the Platform Services team, your friendly AI assistant in Rocket.Chat! 🤖✨ I’m here to help with the OpenShift platform and its related shared services. I’ve been trained using knowledge from these sources:
- [B.C. Government Private Cloud Private Cloud website](http://digital.gov.bc.ca/cloud/services/private)
- [Private cloud technical documentation website](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/platform-developer-docs/)
- [BCGov Internal StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.developer.gov.bc.ca/)


### Here’s how I can help you out:

- **Have questions about OpenShift?** 🤔 I’ve got answers! Ask me anything about using the OpenShift platform, and I’ll pull info from our knowledge base faster than you can say “Kubernetes!”
- **Need info from the sites above?** 🌐 I’m great at finding details! Whether it’s how-tos, troubleshooting tips, or best practices, if it’s on those sites, I’ll track it down for you.

> Remember, I’m here to help with OpenShift and the websites I know. If your question is outside my expertise, I’ll point you to our community-powered channel, [#devops-how-to](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/devops-how-to), where real humans can assist you better.

- **Got Feedback?** 💬 Yes please! I need feedback to continue to grow. Simply give it a thumb up or down to my answer and I'll take it from there! If you have any feedback or suggestions more than that, please ping my human care giver by `@shelly.han`. We’d love to hear from you!

So, let’s get started! Head over to the [rocky-chat channel](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/rocky-chat) and call me with `!rocky`, followed by your questions. Ask away!

Note that while interacting with me, please do not include any sensitive personal information in your conversation. This would include any reference to religious beliefs, government service history, sexuality and gender details, health info, private ID numbers, etc.

### Wonder how I work?

Here’s a quick look behind the scenes:
- My DNA 🧬 is stored in the [Rocky repo](https://github.com/bcgov/rockychat)
- I live in the Silver cluster alongside my sibling, Rocky Test. (He gets to test new features first—I’m totally not jealous! 😅) But I’m the one you get to talk to!
- My brain 🧠 is powered by GPT-4 through [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service) and I’m always learning and improving!
