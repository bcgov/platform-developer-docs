# Platform Services GenAI Chatbot - Rocky

🎉 Hey there! I’m Rocky from the Platform Services Team, your friendly AI assistant in RocketChat! 🤖✨ I focus on the OpenShift platform and shared services related to it. I've been equipped with all the knowledge from the following sources:
- [BC Government Private Cloud Private Cloud website](http://digital.gov.bc.ca/cloud/services/private)
- [Technical Documentation website](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/platform-developer-docs/)

### Here’s how I can help you out:
- **Got Questions about OpenShift?** 🤔 I’ve got answers! Just ask me anything related to OpenShift platform usage, and I’ll fetch the info from our knowledge base faster than you can say “Kubernetes!”
- **Need Info from the websites above?** 🌐 I’m a pro at digging up details from these sites. Whether it’s a questions for the how-tos, troubleshooting, or best practices, as long as it's there somewhere, I’ve got you covered.

> Remember, I’m all about OpenShift and those specific websites. If you ask me something outside my wheelhouse, I’ll redirect you to our community powered channel at #devops-how-to for some real human interaction who can better help you out. 

- **Got Feedback?** 💬 Yes please! I need feedback to continue to grow. Simply give it a thumb up or down to my answer and I'll take it from there! If you have any feedback or suggestions more than that, please ping my human care giver by `@shelly.han`. We’d love to hear from you!

### Wonder how I work?

There are several parts of me that work together:
- My DNA sequence 🧬 is recorded in Rocky repo: https://github.com/bcgov/rockychat
- I live in the Silver cluster, as you might have guessed, I have a sibling called Rocky Test. I'm jealous of him, he gets to try out everything new before me! But anyway, only I get to talk to you 😃
- My brain 🧠 is always evolving, currently you are talking to GPT4 from [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service). I'm always learning and improving!
