# Platform Services GenAI Chatbot - Rocky

🎉 Hi! I’m Rocky from the Platform Services team, your friendly AI assistant in Rocket.Chat! 🤖✨ I’m here to help with the OpenShift platform and its related shared services. I’ve been trained using knowledge from these sources:
- [B.C. Government Private Cloud Private Cloud website](http://digital.gov.bc.ca/cloud/services/private)
- [Private cloud technical documentation website](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/platform-developer-docs/)
- [BCGov Internal StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.developer.gov.bc.ca/)


### Here’s how I can help you out:

- **Have questions about OpenShift?** 🤔 I’ve got answers! Ask me anything about using the OpenShift platform, and I’ll pull info from our knowledge base faster than you can say “Kubernetes!”
- **Need Info from the websites above?** 🌐 I’m a pro at digging up details from these sites. Whether it’s a questions for the how-tos, troubleshooting, or best practices, as long as it's there somewhere, I’ve got you covered.

> Remember, I’m all about OpenShift and those specific websites. If you ask me something outside my wheelhouse, I’ll redirect you to our community powered channel at #devops-how-to for some real human interaction who can better help you out. 

- **Got Feedback?** 💬 Yes please! I need feedback to continue to grow. Simply give it a thumb up or down to my answer and I'll take it from there! If you have any feedback or suggestions more than that, please ping my human care giver by `@shelly.han`. We’d love to hear from you!

So, let’s get started! Head over to the [rocky-chat channel](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/rocky-chat) and call me with `!rocky`, followed by your questions. Ask away!

Note that while interacting with me, please do not include any sensitive personal information in your conversation. This would include any reference to religious beliefs, government service history, sexuality and gender details, health info, private ID numbers, etc.

### Wonder how I work?

There are several parts of me that work together:
- My DNA sequence 🧬 is recorded in Rocky repo: https://github.com/bcgov/rockychat
- I live in the Silver cluster, as you might have guessed, I have a sibling called Rocky Test. I'm jealous of him, he gets to try out everything new before me! But anyway, only I get to talk to you 😃
- My brain 🧠 is always evolving, currently you are talking to GPT4 from [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service). I'm always learning and improving!
