# Training from the Platform Services team

Learning how to build in OpenShift can be hard. We’ve put together a number of resources to help.

## OpenShift 101 and 201

The BC Gov Private Cloud PaaS OpenShift 101 and 201 courses include a theory 'workshop' component, and a practical series of 'lab exercises'. OpenShift 101 is recommended for all new teams joining the platform. OpenShift 201 is a more advanced course for platform users who want to advance their skills in OpenShift.

If the courses fill up, email PlatformServicesTeam@gov.bc.ca - preference is given to recently onboarded teams. If you’re unable to attend a training session, we will soon be offering recordings. 

[Register for an OpenShift course](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/cloud/services/private/support/#platform-training).

You can review the materials for the [OpenShift 101 and OpenShift 201 training](https://github.com/BCDevOps/devops-platform-workshops/blob/master/README.md) 

## How-to-workshops

The [how to workshops](https://github.com/bcgov/how-to-workshops) page hosts some demo projects and quick start guides that may assist you in getting stared with network policies and Crunchy DB databases.
