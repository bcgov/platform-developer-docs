## Where has the issue ocurred?

**If the problem is with a cluster**

In what cluster and namespace are you experiencing the problem? Provide the namespace name, so the community knows exactly where to find the problem.

**If the problem is with a tool**

What tool are you trying to use? Let the community know which platform tool is causing the problem.

**If the problem is with a stack**

Tell us about your stack. What languages and libraries are you using, and which versions of these?

**Additional information**

Also explain what device you were using when you experienced the problem. Were you using a Windows machine, a Mac, an iPhone, an Android or something else? If you were using a web application, what browser were you using? Provide as much detail as possible, including version numbers.

## What are you trying to do?

 Explain what task you were trying to accomplish.
 
-  How you were doing it, and why it was important. The more detail you can provide the better. 
- Let the community know what you were trying to do and what outcome you had expected.

---
## What is the problem?

Now that the community knows what was supposed to happen, tell them what went wrong. Include descriptions of

- How the problem occurred
- What the problem looks like and how it’s behaving. For example, if a screen is failing to load properly, explain how it looks and why it’s not correct. 
- Provide as much detail as possible. If you received an error message, include a screenshot of the message with your question. 

##  What have you done to fix the problem?

The results of your initial troubleshooting efforts can be very useful to the community when they’re trying to determine the cause of your issue. Make sure you include any steps you’ve already taken to resolve the issue, and include as much detail as possible. 

If you’ve been following instructions on a StackOverflow thread, provide a link to the thread. If you’ve been reading documentation about the problem, provide a link to the documentation. 

## What kind of help do you want?
What are you asking the community for? Do you want a solution to the problem? A link to documentation you can use? An alternative way to complete a task? Let the community know what kind of support you’re looking for.

## Posting a question
