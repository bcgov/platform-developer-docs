# AlertManager
Last updated: **March 21, 2024**

We've enhanced OpenShift clusters with basic monitoring and alerting features to keep product teams informed about their applications' health. These features send alerts to the contacts specified in the [Product Registry](https://registry.developer.gov.bc.ca/), notifying them of any common issues their apps might face.

## Alert contacts

Alert emails come from `CLUSTER AlertManager <PlatformServicesTeam@gov.bc.ca>` where CLUSTER is the name of the cluster generating the alert for example: `GOLD`.

Technical Leads for the Product receive all alerts. Additionally, critical level alerts in the `-prod` namespace are forwarded to the Product Owner.

## Frequency

Unresolved Critical level alerts are re-sent every 48 hours. Similarly, warning and info level alerts are re-sent every 5 days if they remain unresolved.

Alerts are triggered only if the condition persists for 1 hour, minimizing unnecessary alerts during ongoing changes.

## Alerts

| **Name** | **Severity** | **Description** |
|---|---|---|
| KubePodCrashLooping | Critical | Pod is stuck in a CrashLoop |
| KubePodNotReady | Critical | Pod is not passing its Readyness probe |
| KubeDeploymentReplicasMismatch | Warning | Deployment has the wrong number of replicas |
| KubeDeploymentGenerationMismatch | Warning | Indicates that the Deployment has failed but has not been rolled back |
| KubeStatefulSetReplicasMismatch | Warning | StatefulSet has the wrong number of replicas |
| KubeStatefulSetGenerationMismatch | Warning | Indicates that the StatefulSet has failed but has not been rolled back |
| KubeStatefulSetUpdateNotRolledOut | Warning | StatefulSet update has not been rolled out |
| KubeContainerWaiting | Critical | Container has been in a waiting state for too long |
| KubeJobNotCompleted | Warning | Job has taken more than 12 hours to complete |
| KubeJobFailed | Warning | Job has failed |
| KubeHpaReplicasMismatch | Warning | HPA does not matched the desired number of replicas, often a quota issue |
| KubeHpaMaxedOut | Warning | HPA is running at max replicas |
| KubePodNotScheduled | Critical | Pod cannot be scheduled to a node |
| KubeQuotaAlmostFull | Info | Quota is 90% used |
| KubeQuotaFullyUsed | Info | Quota is 100% used |
| KubeQuotaExceeded | Warning | Quota is over 100% used |
| KubePersistentVolumeUnbound | Warning | PVC is not bound to a PV |
| KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp | Warning | PVC is 97% full |
| KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp | Warning | PVC is predicted to be full in 4 days |
| KubePersistentVolumeInodesFillingUp | Warning | PVC is running out of free inodes |
| KubePersistentVolumeInodesFillingUp | Warning | PVC is predicted to run out of inodes in 4 days |
| PodDisruptionBudgetAtLimit | Warning | The pod disruption budget is at the minimum disruptions allowed level. The number of current healthy pods is equal to the desired healthy pods. |
| PodDisruptionBudgetLimit | Critical | The pod disruption budget is below the minimum disruptions allowed level and is not satisfied. The number of current healthy pods is less than the desired healthy pods. |

## View in web console

In the **Developer** perspective, select **Observe** -> **<project_name>** -> **Alerts**. In this perspective, alerts, silences, and alerting rules are all managed from the **Alerts** page. The results shown in the **Alerts** page are specific to the selected project.

## Objects

The `platform-services-controlled-alert-routing` configuration in the `AlertManagerConfig` object determines the recipients of the emails, and it doesn't allow any changes.

The `PrometheusRule` object named `platform-services-controlled-alert-rules` outlines the alert rules and their conditions. It's important to note that modifications to this are not allowed.

Feel free to make new `PrometheusRule` objects. They'll be sent to the existing contacts already in place. 

## Timeline

**Gold and Gold DR cluster timeline**

- Beginning August 28, 2023 these alerts are sent out to Product Owners and Technical Leads.

**Silver and Emerald cluster timeline**

- Beginning March 20, 2024 these alerts are sent out to Product Owners and Technical Leads.
