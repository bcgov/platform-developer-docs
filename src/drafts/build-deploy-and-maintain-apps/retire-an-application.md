# Retire an Application

? Link to wordpress page? 

- Short landing page to say:

Applications can be removed from the private cloud platform using the product registry. Learn more about how to retire an app in this document (wordpress link:  https://platform-services-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/our-products-in-the-private-cloud-paas/project-registry/)

- If you no longer need the codebase in your github repo, please consider archiving the repo on github.com . This will indicate the app is no longer supported or active.
